Super market registry
A Supermarket Stock Registry Project is a software system designed to track and manage the inventory of products in a supermarket. It helps store staff to:

Record product details (name, price, quantity, supplier, etc.)
Update stock levels when items are sold or restocked
Monitor low-stock alerts
Generate inventory reports
The goal is to ensure accurate stock records, reduce waste, and maintain availability of products for customers.
